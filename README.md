# Highlights

* Provide a platform for **receiving the notification of test result** <br/>
* Utlizing the blockchain to **prevent falsification of vaccination record and test result** <br/> <br/>


# Inspiration

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people are required to acquire a negative COVID-19 test result before travelling aboard in order to decline the spreading of the disease. As the test result takes time and expenditure, some people are trying to falsify the result. A number of false certificates and fake documents were sold in the airport and on online platforms, like telegram. <br/>

When we are trying to solve this problem, a similar case about falsification of document comes up in our discussion. It is about Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) making a **digital certificate** for graduate students by the technology of blockchain. Whereas blockchain is a technology which stores digital asset in a decentralized way, in the other word, the data is stored in an commonly owned decentralized network which is less easier to be maliciously modified. <br/>

Therefore, we think of using the **blockchain** to make an immunity passport. And we proudly named it as **Halo passport**. <br/><br/>


# What it does

Halo is an app helping users to **tidy up all the vaccination and test record**, also being **an immunity passport** when boarding. <br/>

Considering some travellers having a busy schedule, a **Time Line function** simplfying the blockchain information is designed and shows all the details of the vaccinations and tests did or going to be carry out. It aims to help users to manage and keep up-to-date with all the stuff related to the COVID vaccinations and tests. For example, users can acknowledge when will be the time realeasing the test result and hence read the result at the app. <br/>

After collecting the result, Halo passport can then be used as **an immunity passport**. A quick reponse (QR) code will be generated at the app directing to the record of the vaccinations and tests stored in the blockchain. The Quarentine and Control Officers can scan the QR code to check personal information of the users and status of them. As the record of vaccinations and tests are directly sent from  the testiing laboratories. It is not possible to falsify the result. <br/> <br/>

# How we built it
(...)
### Blockchain network 
We use a test-net ethereum blockchain network from the start to reduce the time needed to create the product. We use the **Ganache** start up the local ethereum blockchain for development. 

For the smart contract, we use the **Truffle** API to deploy it and test the smart contracts using the **Truffle** Console. 

With Smartcontract labs are able to publish the COVID test results for the users and the users can retrieve this information from the blockchain. 


### APP - Frontend 





# Accomplishment we proud of

We, together made a functional and good looking apps at a limited time, which is sooo cool. <br/> <br/>


# What is next for Halo?
(...)

Use IPFS ->Reduce cost
